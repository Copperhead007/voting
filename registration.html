                <h3 style="color:red;">Note: We tried to get a database working but we could not get PHP to work on Tesla. This forced us to have to use JSON which we cannot write to.
                        Therefore, we have populated our JSON file with test users to allow you to log in and use those accounts to test the voting system.
                        All of the logic is there for our registration page but we cannot use anything with the databases because Tesla does not support PHP files.
                        For a list of all test user logins, please see the JSON file attached in our ZIP file on Canvas.</h3>
